# Movie Recommendations System

This repository contains a movie recommendation system based on collaborative filtering techniques. The goal is to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and historical ratings.

## Dataset

The dataset used is typically sourced from movie rating databases such as MovieLens or IMDB. It includes user ratings for various movies, along with movie metadata like genre, release year, and cast.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and transform data into a suitable format for recommendation algorithms.
  
- **Recommendation Algorithms:** Implement collaborative filtering techniques such as User-Based Collaborative Filtering, Item-Based Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition, Alternating Least Squares), and possibly content-based filtering.
  
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate recommendation algorithms using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Precision-Recall curves, and Mean Average Precision (MAP).
  
- **Deployment:** Deploy the recommendation system to generate real-time movie suggestions for users based on their interactions with the system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for exploring notebooks)
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- Access to movie rating datasets (e.g., MovieLens, IMDB)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendations.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore and visualize the movie rating dataset to understand user preferences and movie characteristics.
   
2. **Model Training:** Train recommendation algorithms using scripts provided in the repository, experimenting with different algorithms and hyperparameters.
   
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate algorithm performance using metrics and visualizations provided in the notebooks or scripts.
   
4. **Recommendation Generation:** Use the trained model to generate personalized movie recommendations for users based on their historical ratings or preferences.
